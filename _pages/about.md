Hello! I’m Nina.

A traditional detailed version of my CV can be downloaded here: [CV](./assets/pdf){:target="\_blank"}. I will also do my best to post here news and updates often.
If you are still reading, here’s more about me: Apart from my academic life, I enjoy spending time in nature, mountains, traveling, playing Harmonic & Kalimba. I love learning new languages as well (e.g., It, Fr).
